# Chainlit Codeinterpreter

Chainlit is an AI-driven project designed to carry out various tasks. It is built on a plugin architecture that can easily extend new features.

## Project Features

- **Plugin Architecture**: Chainlit uses a flexible and extensible plugin architecture. Each plugin is a folder containing `functions.py` and `config.json` files, defining the functionality and configuration of the plugin.

- **Function Manager**: The function manager is responsible for parsing and calling the functions defined in the `functions.py` file of each plugin.

- **AI Driven**: Chainlit leverages the power of AI to understand and generate human language, enabling it to handle a variety of tasks.

## Current Plugins

1. **General Plugin**: This plugin provides the functionality of displaying and uploading images.

2. **Python Interpreter Plugin**: This plugin includes a Python executor for running Python code, which is very useful for tasks such as data analysis and table processing.

3. **Vue Plugin**: Currently under development, this plugin is designed to work with Vue projects, automating the entire Vue project modification through the chat interface.

## Plugin Structure and Usage

Each plugin is a directory in the 'plugins' folder. The directory name is the name of the plugin. Each plugin directory contains at least two files:

1. `functions.py`: This file contains the functions provided by the plugin. Each function should be a top-level function (i.e., not a method of a class or an inner function), and should be named in a way that reflects its functionality. Functions can be synchronous or asynchronous.

2. `config.json`: This file contains the configuration of the plugin. It is a JSON file with a required field: `enabled`. If `enabled` is set to `true`, the functions of the plugin will be imported and available for use. If `enabled` is set to `false`, the functions of the plugin will not be imported.

To use a plugin, make sure it is enabled in its `config.json` file. Once enabled, the functions provided by the plugin will be automatically imported when the script runs. The AI assistant will be able to call these functions in the conversation.

## Creating Plugins

To create a plugin, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory in the 'plugins' folder. The directory name will be the name of the plugin.

2. In the new directory, create a file named `functions.py`. In this file, define the functions you want the plugin to provide. Each function should be a top-level function and should be named in a way that reflects its functionality.

3. In the same directory, create a file named `config.json`. In this file, add the following JSON:

```json
{
    "enabled": true
}
```

This will enable the plugin by default. If you want to disable the plugin, you can change `true` to `false`.

## Running the Project

To run this project, you need to follow these steps:

1. First, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. You can do this by copying the `.env.example` file.

2. In the `.env` file, you need to provide your OpenAI API key. This should be a string, like `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`. Please replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

3. Still in the `.env` file, you need to set the base URL for the OpenAI API. This should be a string, like `OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1`.

4. After saving the `.env` file, you need to install Chainlit. You can do this with pip: `pip install chainlit`.

5. Once Chainlit is installed, you can run the project with the following command: `chainlit run app.py -w`.
