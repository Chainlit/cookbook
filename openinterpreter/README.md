Open Interpreter lets LLMs run code (Python, Javascript, Shell, and more) locally. You can chat with Open Interpreter through a ChatGPT-like interface in your terminal by running $ interpreter after installing.


This Chainlit cookbook example allows you to do just that from a web app, with additional UI features such as file uploads, downloads, Images and other UI Elements.

This is an example combining both to provide a code interpreter-like app.

### Let the games begin!

1. Select your LLM
2. (Optional) Upload a file
3. Chat away!
