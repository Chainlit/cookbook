# Llama Index Chat Application

This application integrates a chat interface with a retriever-type query engine, providing a streamlined way to interact with and retrieve information from a document index using natural language queries.

## High-Level Description

The chat application is built using the `chainlit` framework and leverages the `llama_index` package for indexing and querying documents. It uses OpenAI's GPT models for natural language understanding and response generation.

When the chat starts, the application initializes a `LLMPredictor` with the `ChatOpenAI` model, setting up the service context and query engine. The query engine is stored in the user's session for subsequent use.

Upon receiving a message, the application retrieves the query engine from the session, processes the query, and sends back the response. The response can be either a simple text response or a streaming response, depending on the nature of the query.

## Quickstart

To get started with this application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository containing the application.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root directory of the project.
4. Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with your OpenAI API key.
5. Run the application using `python chainlit-cookbook/llama-index/app.py`.

### Code Definitions

- `LLMPredictor`: A class that wraps around the language model, facilitating the prediction of responses based on the input queries.
- `ServiceContext`: Holds the context for the service, including the language model predictor and callback manager.
- `StorageContext`: Manages the storage of the index, allowing for persistence across sessions.
- `RetrieverQueryEngine`: The engine that processes queries and retrieves relevant documents from the index.
