# Running DeepSeek R1 with Chainlit

This example shows how to use DeepSeek R1 while exposing the reasoning to the user using the Chainlit `Step` class.

Two variants are available in this example:

1. Using [Ollama](./ollama.py) to run R1 locally.
2. Using the [DeepSeek API](./deepseek_api.py). This requires the `DEEP_SEEK_API_KEY` env variable.
