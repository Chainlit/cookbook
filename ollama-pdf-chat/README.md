## ðŸ’» Installation

- Prerequisites:

  - [Chatlit](https://docs.chainlit.io/)
  - [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/)
  - [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)

First we need to install Ollama into your system. You can do this by going to this [website](https://ollama.com/) and following the instructions provided there.

Then start the Ollama server with the following command:

```bash
    sudo systemctl start ollama
```

Now, to check if the server is running, use the following command:

```bash
    sudo systemctl status ollama
```

Once the server is ready and running, we need to install the required models for the application. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
    ollama pull <model_name>
```

After this step you need to clone the repository

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KTS-o7/cookbook.git
```

go into the directory

```bash
    cd ollama-pdf-chat
```

We need to create a virtual environment for the application

```bash
    python3 -m venv ./env
    source ./env/bin/activate
```

and then install the required dependencies

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set environment variables for the application
in a `.env` file in the root directory of the application.
We have provided an example environment file [here](./exampleEnv)

```bash
    touch .env
    echo "ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False" >> .env
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage

> You need to keep the required pdfs in a folder called `files` in the root directory of the application.
> Call the ingestor to ingest the pdfs

```bash
    python ingestor.py
```

Once all these are done you can start the application by running the following command:

```bash
    chainlit run multiChat.py
```

> OR

If you want to chat with just one PDF file, you can run the following command:

```bash
    chainlit run InstantChat.py
```

> Customization to theme can be done by chainging the config.toml file inside `.chainlit` directory.
> An example config.toml file is also given
