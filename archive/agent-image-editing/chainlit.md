# 🎨 Chainlit Image Gen demo

Welcome to our creative image generation demo built with [Chainlit](https://chainlit.io), [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html), and [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/)! 🌟 This app allows you to create and edit unique images simply by chatting with it. Talk about having an artistic conversation! 🎨🗨️

This demo has also been adapted to use the new [ChatSettings](https://docs.chainlit.io/concepts/chat-settings) feature introduced in chainlit `0.6.2`. You are now able to tweak Stability AI settings to your liking!

## 🎯 Example

Try asking:
```
Anime style snowy swiss mountains lit by the moon. Clear night sky. HD.
```

![Result](https://chainlit-cloud.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/docs/img-gen-0.jpg)

You can then ask for modifications:
```
change the clear night sky with a starry sky
```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
Please note that the primary goal of this demo is to showcase the ease and convenience of building LLM apps using Chainlit and other tools rather than presenting a state-of-the-art image generation application.
