    Parameters: code: (str, required): A Python code snippet for execution in a Jupyter environment, where variables and imports from previously executed code are accessible. The code must not rely on external variables/imports not available in this environment, and must print a dictionary `{"type": "<type>", "path": "<path>", "status": "<status>"}` as the last operation. `<type>` can be "image", "file", or "content", `<path>` is the file path (not needed if `<type>` is "content"), `<status>` indicates execution status. Display operations should save output as a file with path returned in the dictionary. If tabular data is generated, it should be directly returned as a string. The code must end with a `print` statement.the end must be print({"type": "<type>", "path": "<path>", "status": "<status>"})
