# Running DeepSeek R1 with Chainlit


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fe6d64a-f472-4a0c-99c0-fa8615e24dfc


This example shows how to use DeepSeek R1 while exposing the reasoning to the user using the Chainlit `Step` class.

Two variants are available in this example:

1. Using [Ollama](./ollama.py) to run R1 locally.
2. Using the [DeepSeek API](./deepseek_api.py). This requires the `DEEP_SEEK_API_KEY` env variable.
